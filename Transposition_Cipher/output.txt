I think Keller is saying that most people do not follow things that will get them true happiness regardless of what they think they will be rewarded with. She is saying that self gratification is not the answer to fulfillment. 
Fulfillment is not attainted through actions done to benefit yourself, but through loyalty and giving of yourself to a worthy case in which you believe. If you give of yourself, your time, and your life to a good cause and effort that you believe in then you will be rewarded in yourself.
